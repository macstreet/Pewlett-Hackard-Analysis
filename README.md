# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
For this analysis, we pulled multiple tables of data on employees who were near retirement as well as who was eligible for the mentorship program. We also created a table that provided a breakdown of how many employees are close to retirement within each job title.

## Results
- There are 90,398 unduplicated current employees who are at retirement age.
- There were about 43,379 title changes within this group of employees at retirement age
- As seen in the table below, most employees who are at retirement age are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff

- Our analysis showed that 15,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

    Of the employees in retirement age, a total of 90,398 roles will need to be filled. The roles that will see the greatest need are the Senior Engineer and the Senior Staff, at 29,415 employees and 28,255, respectively.  

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  There are 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program, which only makes up about 2% of number of roles that may be vacant due to the employee retiring. Based on these numbers, I would assess that Pewlett-Hackard does not currently have enough employees qualified to provide mentorship to meet the need. 


It might be helpful to expand the eligibility criteria for the mentorship program, probably starting with birthdate. Furthermore, it would be important to break down how many mentors hold each titles, in order to ensure you are matching the need as employees retire.
